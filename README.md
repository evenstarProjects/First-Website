# First Website
 
This is the first website I have created on the MadLab Intro to Web Development course.

This Mark Down File will also serve as a place to practice my Markdown Syntax.

# is a First-Level Heading.
## is a Second-Level Heading.
### is a Third-Level Heading.

**This text is Bold** or __double underscore__
*This text is Italics* or _single underscore_
~~This is Strikethrough~~

> This is a Quote

To make text appear as code we use `Back Ticks` and it will change the appearance of the contsined words.

Triple backticks ```creates a block of code.```
